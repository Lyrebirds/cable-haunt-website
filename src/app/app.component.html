            Cable Haunt is a critical vulnerability found in cable modems from various manufacturers across the world.
            The vulnerability enables remote attackers to gain complete control of a cable modem, through an endpoint on
            the modem. Your cable modem is in charge of the internet traffic for all devices on the network. Cable Haunt
            might therefore be exploited to intercept private messages, redirect traffic, or participation in botnets.
          </p>
          <p class="mat-body-2">
            The vulnerable endpoint is exposed to the local network, but can be reached remotely due to improper
            websocket usage. Through malicious communication with this endpoint, a <a target="_blank"
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffer_overflow">buffer overflow</a> can be exploited to gain control
            of the modem. The technical report can be downloaded below.

            An estimated 200 million modems may be or might have been vulnerable in Europe alone. However it is very
            hard to give a precise estimate of the reach of Cable Haunt. The reason for this, is that the vulnerability
            originated in reference software, which have seemingly been copied by different cable modems manufacturers,
            when creating their cable modem firmware. This means that we have not been able to track the exact spread of
            the vulnerability, and that it might present itself in slightly different ways for different manufacturers.
            The purpose of this website, is to inform as many affected users and providers as possible, in order to
            improve their ability to protect themselves.

          <p class="mat-body-2">
            Cable Haunt is exploited in two steps. First, access to the vulnerable endpoint is gained through a client
            on the local network, such as a browser. Secondly the vulnerable endpoint is hit with a buffer overflow
            attack,
            which gives the attacker control of the modem.
          </p>
          <div class="mat-title">Accessing the Endpoint</div>
          <p class="mat-body-2">
            The endpoint, which serves a tool called spectrum analyzer, uses a websocket for communication with the
            graphical frontend displayed in a browser. Whereas <a target="_blank"
              href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS" target="_blank">CORS</a> would restrict
            access to such an endpoint for HTTP requests, websocket is not protected by this protocol. Therefore, it is
            up to the server to verify the relevant request parameters added by the browser. Because these parameters
            are never inspected by the cable modem, the websocket will accept requests made by javascript running in the
            browser regardless of origin, thereby allowing attackers to reach the endpoint. It should be noted that the
            exploit is not limited to run in a browser. Any place where running code can reach an IP on the local
            network, can be used to exploit Cable Haunt.
          </p>
          <div class="mat-title">Taking Control</div>
          <p class="mat-body-2">
            Once the websocket has been reached, the buffer overflow vulnerability can be exploited. The websocket
            requests are given as JSON. The parser which interprets this JSON request, will copy the input parameters to
            a buffer, regardless of length, allowing values on the stack to be overwritten. Among these values are
            saved registers, such as the program counter and return address. With a carefully crafted message the modem
            can be manipulated to execute arbitrary code specified by a remote attacker. Once control has been achieved
            by an attacker, it can be abused in many ways. Some examples are:

              The script automatically scans your network to find the spectrum analyser and tries to establish
              connection to the websocket. The script will test if the modem rejects requests from an external origin,
              by setting the header parameters similar to how a browser or other modern client would. If the
              connection is established the spectrum analyser can be reached indirectly from outside the local network
              and is, at least partly, vulnerable. The script will afterwards, with your permission, send a specially
              crafted package that reboots the modem if vulnerable. If this happens the modem is completely vulnerable.

                  The most important thing right now is to get this information out to the modem manufacturers as
                  quickly as possible, such that firmware updates can be created for modems still affected.
                  If your ISP have already reported to us that they have fixed the issue, we will add them to the <a
                    (click)="scrollToAndExpand('faq-am-i-affected', 0)">list above</a>.
                  If your ISP is not in this list, we recommend that you contact them and ask if your unit is or ever
                  was vulnerable to Cable Haunt.

                <p class="mat-body-2">
                  If you are the owner of your modem, start by checking if the modem is on the <a

                    of vulnerable modems</a>, and if it has an updated firmware available. Even if your modem is not on
                  the list, it may still be vulnerable. Check with the manufacturer of your modem if the latest firmware
                  prevents Cable Haunt, and if the modem were ever vulnerable. If you suspect that your modem has been
                  compromised, update the firmware to a version not vulnerable to Cable Haunt. Then you should consider
                  if your past non-encrypted internet traffic contains sensitive information, such as passwords or
                  personal
                  emails, and take precautions accordingly.

                  First you should determine which of you modems are vulnerable. We recommend letting your technical

                  where they find a list containing modems already known to be vulnerable and
                  tools that help them test modems not included in the list. We also highly recommend letting your
                  technical personnel download and read <a
                    (click)="scrollToCenter('technical-report-download-button')">the technical report</a>. The report
                  contains the full vulnerability and all technical details needed to replicate, understand and test for
                  the vulnerability. This should help them understand the vulnerability in depth and determine which of
                  your modems are affected. When you have confirmed which of your modems are vulnerable, please let us
                  know the model and latest affected firmware version so that we can append the models to the list of
                  affected modems. If you need further help you are welcome to <a

                  Next step is to create a firmware for the affected modems. While the report gives some understanding
                  for which parameters the reader should keep in mind when designing a solution, it focuses on
                  explaining the vulnerability, not a solution. You should contact your modem manufacturer and ask them
                  to create a new firmware that is not vulnerable which you can roll out as quickly as possible. There
                  are possible mitigation strategies you can employ while your manufacturer creates the new firmware but
                  these are out of scope for this FAQ. If you need help with mitigation or firmware for modems that are

                  While rolling out the firmware it is important to keep your customers informed so they know exactly
                  when they are secure again. When all modems are updated inform your customers and help them take the
                  necessary precautions against potential attacks that could have happened while the modem was
                  vulnerable.

                  The vulnerabilities can be found in different variations across different firmware versions. As a
                  small team, we lack the means to map out the affected systems, and we would be very thankful for any
                  help with expanding the list of confirmed vulnerable cable modems. Please download the <a

              No. This does not break encryption, as long as your connection is properly established between you and the
              intended recipient. However, your modem is most likely doing your DNS lookups and can act as a proxy, so
              you might still be in some trouble.
              With mechanisms like HSTS, exploiting this is becoming increasingly difficult, but not impossible.

            <p class="mat-body-2">
              Probably not. The randomized password is usually only for the administration panel. Cable Haunt does not
              attack the administration panel, but a different web service, which runs separately. It is theoretically
              possible, that your model has randomized passwords for the spectrum analyzer as well, but it is highly
              unlikely.

              There is also an entire discussion to be had about shared passwords for 'technicians', which circumvent
              the randomized passwords given on a sticker, but that is an issue for a different site.

              Not in general. The spectrum analyzer's websocket server is not compatible with the websocket version
