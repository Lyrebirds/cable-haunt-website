          <p class="mat-body-2">
            Cable Haunt is a critical vulnerability found in cable modems from various manufacturers across the world.
            The vulnerability enables remote attackers to execute abitrary code on your modem, indirectly through an
            endpoint on
            the modem. Your cable modem is in charge of the internet traffic for all devices on the network. Cable Haunt
            might therefore be exploited to intercept private messages, redirect traffic, or participation in botnets.
          </p>
          <p class="mat-body-2">
            The vulnerable endpoint is exposed to the local network, but can be reached remotely due to improper
            WebSocket usage. Through malicious communication with this endpoint, a <a target="_blank"
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffer_overflow">buffer overflow</a> can be exploited to gain control
            of the modem. The technical report can be downloaded below.

          <p class="mat-body-2">
            There are an estimated 200 million cable modems in Europe alone. With almost no cable modem tested being
            secure without a firmware update, the number of modems initially vulnerable in Europe is estimated to be
            close to this number. However, it is tough to give a precise estimate of the reach of Cable Haunt. The
            reason for this is that the vulnerability originated in reference software, which has seemingly been copied
            by different cable modems manufacturers when creating their cable modem firmware. This means that we have
            not been able to track the exact spread of the vulnerability and that it might present itself in slightly
            different ways for different manufacturers. We have contacted as many of the largest ISPs and manufacturers
            as we could ahead of time, to give them time to fix the issue, but with varying success. Some of the
            contacted ISPs have informed us that they have or are rolling out firmware updates; however, we are still
            missing updates form several, and some have whished not to be listed on this website. The ISPs that have
            confirmed their modems are secure can be found <a

          <p class="mat-body-2">
            Cable Haunt is exploited in two steps. First, access to the vulnerable endpoint is gained through a client
            on the local network, such as a browser. Secondly the vulnerable endpoint is hit with a buffer overflow
            attack,
            which gives the attacker control of the modem.
          </p>
          <div class="mat-title">Accessing the Endpoint</div>
          <p class="mat-body-2">
            The endpoint, which serves a tool called spectrum analyzer, uses a WebSocket for communication with the
            graphical frontend displayed in a browser. Whereas <a target="_blank"
              href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS" target="_blank">CORS</a> would restrict
            access to such an endpoint for HTTP requests, WebSocket is not protected by this protocol. Therefore, it is
            up to the server to verify the relevant request parameters added by the browser. Because these parameters
            are never inspected by the cable modem, the WebSocket will accept requests made by javascript running in the
            browser regardless of origin, thereby allowing attackers to reach the endpoint. It should be noted that the
            exploit is not limited to run in a browser. Any place where running code can reach an IP on the local
            network, can be used to exploit Cable Haunt.
          </p>
          <div class="mat-title">Taking Control</div>
          <p class="mat-body-2">
            Once the WebSocket has been reached, the buffer overflow vulnerability can be exploited. The WebSocket
            requests are given as JSON. The parser which interprets this JSON request, will copy the input parameters to
            a buffer, regardless of length, allowing values on the stack to be overwritten. Among these values are
            saved registers, such as the program counter and return address. With a carefully crafted message the modem
            can be manipulated to execute arbitrary code specified by a remote attacker. Once control has been achieved
            by an attacker, it can be abused in many ways. Some examples are:

              Start by determining if you get internet through a cable modem, since only cable modems are affected.
              If you do, you may be affected.
              Most people get their cable modem through their ISP.
              This means that the ISP is responsible for the firmware running on it and most likely have the means to

              The script automatically scans your network to find the spectrum analyser and tries to establish
              connection to the WebSocket. The script will test if the modem rejects requests from an external origin,
              by setting the header parameters similar to how a browser or other modern client would. If the
              connection is established the spectrum analyser can be reached indirectly from outside the local network
              and is, at least partly, vulnerable. The script will afterwards, with your permission, send a specially
              crafted package that reboots the modem if vulnerable. If this happens the modem is completely vulnerable.

              It is very hard to detect whether your cable modem has already been exploited since Cable Haunt can be
              exploited
              for full control and a skilled person could therefore thoroughly cover their tracks. However, even though
              the vulnerability allows arbitrary code to be executed, it
              requires a lot of work from the attacker to find the needed commands and craft the package, for exploiting
              full control. For your average Joe, as long as "easy-to-use" exploit packages for specific modems have not
              been crafted, they are not the target. Which is one of the reasons for this website and why it is
              important Cable Haunt is fixed quickly.

              It is hard to say across all models, if the vulnerable endpoint is available when operating in bridge
              mode. We have however received several reports from individual users across the world, where the modem was
              still vulnerable even in bridge mode, so this is definitely not a security guarantee.
              If your modem is running behind a separate router/gateway, you might be safe by configuring a firewall
              restriction on the spectrum analyzer. In any case, it is a decent mitigation strategy, while waiting for

                  If you have the ability to update your cable modem yourself, check if your manufacturer have released
                  a patch that fixes the vulnerability and apply it.
                  Unfortunately, for most ISPs users are not able to update their modems themselves.
                  Therefore, for the vast majority of people the important thing right now is to get this information
                  out to the modem manufacturers as quickly as possible, preferably through your ISP, such that firmware
                  updates can be created and pushed to the modems by the ISP.
                  If your ISP have already reported to us that they have fixed the issue, we will add them to the <a

              Yes. The vulnerable endpoint is only accessible on the local network, however due to compatibility
              concerns, WebSocket is not blocked by CORS and SOP in modern browsers. Since the Spectrum Analyzer
              webserver does not check the Host and Origin parameters set by the browser, any javascript running in the
              users browser are able to send an exploit package to the modem. This could be exploited by an attacker if
              you visit a malicious website or if they embed the code, for instance in an advert, on a trusted
              website. It is important to point out that this is not the only attack vector that can be employed,
              vulnerable mail-clients, exploited IoT devices, public networks etc. are also viable attack vectors.

              directly and indirectly through ISPs and manufacturers.
              Close to the release, we got contacted by Broadcom who informed us that they had fixed the issue
              in their reference code back in April 2019 due to one of our reports, sent through an ISP. Broadcom has

              Due to the nature of reference code, Broadcom have no centralized release structure to utilize for
              patching. The manufacturers decide what to do with the code received from Broadcom, and since a large
              number have copied the vulnerability any patch need to be implemented by the manufacturer. Neither
              Broadcom nor any of contacted manufacturers have agreed to send us either the original reference code or

              No. This does not break encryption, as long as your connection is properly established between you and the

              Probably not. The randomized password is usually only for the administration panel. Cable Haunt does not
              attack the administration panel, but a different web service, which runs separately. It is theoretically
              possible, that your model has randomized passwords for the spectrum analyzer as well, but it is highly

                Why Is It Called Cable Haunt?

              Cable Haunt exists solely in cable modems, where it have lived a silent, invisible and spectral existence.
              It has haunted the COAX cables across the world for
              many years and due to its origins in reference code, it will be hard to truly say when it has been
              exorcised from all affected modems... Also, spectre was taken.

                A Branded Vulnerability? Is That Really Warranted?

              Perhaps not. This is not heartbleed, EternalBlue, Meltdown or Row Hammer, and we have no illusions about
              this. And yes, Samuel Gross' recent publication of a vulnerability in iMessage much more technically
              interesting than a buffer overflow in cable modems. While exploitation, WebSockets aversion to CORS and
              SOP and creating ROP-chains in MIPS architecture, is interesting it is clear that it is the scale, and its
              spread across different manufacturers, that gives this vulnerability public significance.

              So Why Did You Brand It Anyway?

              The vulnerability was found across 4 different vendors, with a strong suspicion that these were not the
              only ones. (a suspicion that have since been confirmed). We have worked hard for nearly a year now to try
              and spread the information amongst ISPs, manufacturers and suppliers. And even while some have been
              graciously working with us, we could tell that it would have taken us several years to get the information
              out.

              At this rate it would eventually leak out of our hands and into organizations with time and resources to
              take advantage of the vulnerability. This is not fair for the users and would help expand, on scale, the
              ever growing problems with cyber security companies and people face every day.
            </p>
            <p class="mat-body-2">
              Without a way of unifying the issue across vendors, the chances of it being fixed universally were very
              slim.

            <p class="mat-body-2">
              We are a small unknown crew with no reputation, and could therefore not establish connection with any
              manufacturers directly, even though we tried. With no avenue for significantly spreading the message, and
              having no followers, pitching a multistage exploit to major international providers and manufacturers,
              would not have been noticed by all the right people in time.
            </p>
            <p class="mat-body-2">
              Due to the origin of the vulnerability, we did not have the option of going to the owner of the code, and
              let them deploy a patch from a central source. In which case, this website would not exist.
            </p>
            <p class="mat-body-2">
              From our perspective, our only choice was to go big and branded to try to reach the affected end-users and
              let awareness bubble up from there. With this we run the risk of being seen as fearmongering upstarts who
              tries to sensationalize a buffer overflow in modems which some people would say is almost expected to be
              vulnerable. But this universal acceptance of modems and routers being insecure was not something we wanted
              to add to.
